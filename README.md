## Dashboard

-This project is a demonstration of my front-end development skills, creating an example website for a financial dashboad. The main goal was to showcase interactive divs, and responsive design using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project was built to provide an overview of my work, including coding and design skills. The site is user-friendly, intuitive, and has a pleasant and clean interface. I would like to thank you for visiting this project and hope it provides a good understanding of my front-end development skills.

## üöÄ Starting

To download the file from the Git repository, follow these steps:

* Go to the Git repository where the file is located.
* Click on the "Clone or download" button.
* Click on "Download ZIP" to download the repository as a ZIP file.
* Extract the ZIP file to a folder on your local machine.

### üìã Prerequisites

To properly view your web page developed in HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript, the user will need a modern web browser that supports these technologies.

The recommended browsers for viewing your page are:

* Google Chrome (version 22 or higher)
* Mozilla Firefox (version 16 or higher)
* Safari (version 6 or higher)
* Microsoft Edge (version 12 or higher)
* Opera (version 12.1 or higher)

It is important to note that while these are the minimum recommended versions, it is always best to use the latest available versions to ensure the best possible experience for the user.

### üîß Instalation

To run the example on the page, follow these steps:

* Open the folder where you extracted the ZIP file.
* Navigate to the folder where the HTML file is located.
* Double-click on the HTML file to open it in your default web browser.
* The example should now be running in your web browser.

It's important to note that all file paths in the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files are relative paths, so the example should be able to run on any device without any additional setup.

## üì¶ Implantation

To deploy your web page on a hosting provider, follow these steps:

* Purchase a hosting plan from a provider of your choice and log in to your hosting account.
* Create a new directory at the root of the hosting. This directory will be used to store all the files of your web page.
* Transfer all the files of your web page to this directory using an FTP (File Transfer Protocol) client.
* Verify that the server configuration is correct to support HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript. If necessary, contact the provider for assistance.
* Verify that the URL address for your web page is correct and that the main HTML file is in the root of the directory.
* Open your web browser and access the URL to verify that the web page is working correctly.

It's important to remember that each hosting provider may have its own specific configurations and processes, so refer to the provider's documentation for detailed instructions on how to deploy your web page in their environment.
